Make a c++ code; (one program only)
make sure the display has verification if there's a content for the display (stack and queue)
Header should have stack,vector,queue,iostream, 
Tasks:

1. create an integer array, composing a 10 elements with values ranging from 20-60 (this is unsorrted)
= display using for loop the content of the array

2. create 1 stacks and 1 queue container that can store the content of the inital array (use an insert function)
 ;pop 3x for the said stacks
 ;display the content of the stack and queue

3.combine the content of the stack and queue in one container (14 elements will be retain) 
 ;stack will be the first content
 ;queue will follow 
 ;this will be called data merging. Print the results afterwards

 4. Create a 4 sorting algorithm functions that can be called, and insert the array
 ;content of data merging will be inserted on the sorting algorithm
 ; data of data merge will run thru the 4 sorting
 E.g. selection sort this content

 5.chrono function (estimate time complexity of each algorithm)
 ;between running of the 4sorting algorithm, monitor the time complexity of the 4 sorting
 ;(start run bubble sort, end)
 repeat 4x - create a conlusion

 the main and functions are different = bubble time complexity = milliseconds (mm)
